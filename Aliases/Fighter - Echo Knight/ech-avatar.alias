As an action, you can see through your echoâ€™s eyes and hear through its ears. During this time, you are deafened and blinded. You can sustain this effect for up to 10 minutes, and you can end it at any time (requires no action). While your echo is being used in this way, it can be up to 1,000 feet away from you without being destroyed." -f "*7th-level Echo Knight feature*" -thumb <image> -color <color>
