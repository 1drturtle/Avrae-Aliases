-desc "*Squeesh has given you a piece of the powers and talents he holds dear to himself. He only hopes you can find great use of them in your times of need*

▪︎***Squeesh's Word Of Freedom:*** *You may, as an action break a spell that is stunning, restraining, or paralyzing you, you can use this feature once per long rest.*

▪︎***The Warrior of the Forge:*** *You gain resistance to Thunder damage.*

▪︎***Squeesh's Orb of Life:*** *Once per long rest, you may take 1 bonus action to produce an impenetrable bubble around yourself and up to 2 allies within 5 feet of you. It lasts for 5 rounds or until it takes 5 times your character level in damage of any type, it has an AC of 10+proficiency. If you do this with an enemy in your melee range, they must succeed a dex save (DC: 16) or be pushed back 15 ft and take 3d6 force damage, half on a success. When the bubble pops, the speed of every creature in the bubble is reduced by half and they all lose their action on that turn. All healing is maxed within the bubble and all creatures in the bubble get healed Charmaine's wisdom mod at the beginning of their turn if they are still in the bubble.*"
